# Project Structure Documentation

This document provides a detailed, beginner-friendly explanation of the project's structure, how each component is used within the Next.js framework, and how everything fits together.

### **High-Level Overview**

The most important folder in your project is `src`, which contains all of your application's source code. Inside `src`, you have a few key directories:

*   **`app`**: The heart of your Next.js application, where all your pages and routes are defined.
*   **`components`**: This is where all your reusable UI components live, neatly organized into subdirectories.
*   **`contexts`**: This directory holds your React Context providers, which allow you to share data across your application without passing it down through multiple levels of components.
*   **`utils`**: A place for utility functions and constants that can be used anywhere in your application.

### **The `app` Directory: Your Application's Core**

The `app` directory is central to how your Next.js application works. Each folder inside `app` represents a different route or page. For example, `app/dashboard` would create a page at `your-website.com/dashboard`.

*   **`page.js`**: This is the main entry point for your home page. It's a simple file that imports the `HomePage` component and renders it.
*   **`layout.js`**: This file defines the root layout for your entire application. It wraps around all your pages and is the perfect place to include elements that are shared across every page, like your main font.

### **The `components` Directory: Building Blocks of Your UI**

Your `components` directory is where you'll spend most of your time. It's organized to help you find and reuse components easily.

#### `components/layout`

This directory contains the components that define the overall structure of your pages.

*   **`Header.jsx`**: Your website's header, which includes the navigation bar and the hero section.
*   **`Footer.jsx`**: Your website's footer.
*   **`Main.jsx`**: A wrapper for the main content of your pages.
*   **`PageWrapper.jsx`**: A component that wraps around your entire page, providing a consistent layout.
*   **`Navigation/`**: This directory holds your navigation components.
    *   **`Navigation.jsx`**: The main navigation bar with links to different sections.
    *   **`Hamurger.jsx`**: The hamburger menu icon for mobile devices.

#### `components/pages`

This directory is for components that represent an entire page.

*   **`HomePage.jsx`**: The main component for your home page. It brings together all the different sections (like `Dashboard`, `Features`, and `Pricing`) to create the full page.

#### `components/sections`

These are the building blocks of your pages, each representing a distinct section.

*   **`Dashboard.jsx`**: The section that displays your application's dashboard preview.
*   **`AppStatistics.jsx`**: Shows statistics about your application.
*   **`Features.jsx`**: Highlights the key features of your product.
*   **`Pricing/`**: Contains components related to your pricing plans.
    *   **`Pricing.jsx`**: The main pricing section component.
    *   **`PricingCard.jsx`**: A reusable card for displaying individual pricing plans.
*   **`Testimonials/`**: Holds components for customer testimonials.
    *   **`Testimonials.jsx`**: The main testimonials section.
    *   **`Testimonial.jsx`**: A single testimonial card.
*   **`CTA.jsx`**: Your "Call to Action" section, encouraging users to sign up or get started.
*   **`Hero.jsx`**: The main hero section at the top of your home page.

#### `components/UI`

This directory is for smaller, reusable UI elements that can be used anywhere.

*   **`Modal.jsx`**: A modal dialog component.
*   **`MoreInformation.jsx`**: A component for displaying additional information, likely within a modal.
*   **`Toggle.jsx`**: A toggle switch component.

### **How It All Fits Together**

1.  When a user visits your website, Next.js starts with `app/layout.js` to set up the basic HTML structure.
2.  Then, it renders `app/page.js`, which in turn renders the `HomePage` component from `components/pages/HomePage.jsx`.
3.  The `HomePage` component is wrapped in `PageWrapper.jsx`, which provides the overall page structure.
4.  Inside `HomePage`, the `Header`, `Main`, and `Footer` components from the `layout` directory are used to organize the content.
5.  Finally, the `Main` component is filled with the various section components (`Dashboard`, `Features`, etc.) to build out the full page.

This structure keeps your code organized, makes it easy to find and update components, and is a great foundation for building a larger application.
